            <b>Scenario Question:</b><br />
            You have been given a task to automate a process in Salesforce. Upon
            creating a new account, the system should automatically generate two
            contacts. Additionally, three opportunities need to be created with
            specific names: Opp-A1-1, Opp-A1-2, and Opp-A1-3. The opportunities
            have three status options: Initial, In Progress, and Final. "In
            Progress" represents 75% completion, and "Final" indicates 100%
            completion.<br /><br />

            Your objective is to implement a validation rule that triggers when
            the status of an opportunity is changed from "In Progress" to
            "Initial." The validation rule should display an error message to
            prevent this transition from occurring prematurely.<br /><br />

            Outline the steps you would take to create and implement this
            validation rule, ensuring that it aligns with the specified criteria
            and error messaging requirements.
